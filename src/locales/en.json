  "missionaryWork.faq.q1": "What is the role of the Elders Quorum in missionary work?",
  "missionaryWork.faq.a1": "The Elders Quorum, under the direction of the bishop, leads missionary work in the ward. Their main responsibility is to coordinate members' efforts to find, teach, and baptize interested individuals. This includes working closely with full-time missionaries, organizing missionary activities, and ensuring new converts are integrated and supported.",
  "missionaryWork.faq.q2": "How do we work with full-time missionaries?",
  "missionaryWork.faq.a2": "Collaboration is key. The quorum presidency should meet regularly with the missionaries in missionary correlation meetings to coordinate plans. Quorum members can help missionaries by providing referrals, participating in lessons, offering transportation, and opening their homes for activities.",
  "missionaryWork.faq.q3": "What does it mean to \"assign friends\" to a new convert, and why is it important?",
  "missionaryWork.faq.a3": "Assigning friends (often called \"ministering brothers\" or simply quorum friends) is crucial for retaining new members. A new convert needs support, friendship, and guidance. Assigning one or two quorum members to befriend the new member, visit them, invite them to activities, and answer their questions helps them feel part of the community and strengthens their testimony.",
  "missionaryWork.faq.q4": "What kind of missionary assignments can the quorum have?",
  "missionaryWork.faq.a4": "Assignments can be varied: accompanying the missionaries to a lesson, inviting a friend to a Church activity, sharing a Gospel message on social media, helping an investigator with a move as an act of service, or organizing a home evening open to friends of the Church.",
